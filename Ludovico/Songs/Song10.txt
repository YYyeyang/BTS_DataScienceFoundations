He got a frame like a busted bike
He got a face that nobody likes to see
Nobody but me
He got a thing or two to learn about love
He act like he ain’t never heard of romance
So why’d I give him a chance?
My baby can dance
My baby can swing
My baby can shake me slow
So I don’t need no other thing
My baby can dance
My baby can sway
My baby can hold me tight enough
to drive my cares away
We go out to the joint downtown
I dress up and he dress down but it
don’t matter one bit
Cus we got something better than class
Who needs love when love don’t last that long?
and all we need is a song
My baby can dance
My baby can groove
My baby can shut me up
so I listen to the music and move
My baby can dance
My baby can sway
My baby can hold me tight enough
to drive my cares away
My baby can dance
