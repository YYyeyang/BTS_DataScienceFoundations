Oh, lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Always here, when you sigh,
Never in my woodland could there be words to reveal
In a phrase how i feel.
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we get from our lips
When we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, then we'll go
Flying high in Birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love
Lullaby, lullaby
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we get from our lips
When we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, then we'll go
Flying high in Birdland, high in the sky up above
And it's all because we're in love
